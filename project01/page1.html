                <p>the single crochet is great for items that should be thicker and 
                    less mesh like than the double crochet. </p>
                    <p> How to make it: Make a foundation chain. Insert the hook into the second 
                        chain from the hook. Yarn over the hook and pull through so that you have 
                        two looks on your hook. Yarn over the hook again and pull through both loops. 
                        Now youâ€™re left with one loop, inserting the hook into the next stitch on 
                        the foundation chain, repeat the process again until you are finished with 
                        your pattern.</p>
